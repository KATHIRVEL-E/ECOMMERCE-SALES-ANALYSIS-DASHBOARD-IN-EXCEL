# 📊 E-commerce Sales Analysis Dashboard  

This repository contains an Excel-based interactive dashboard designed for analyzing e-commerce sales performance.

The dashboard is built to help business analysts, managers, and decision-makers track key performance indicators (KPIs), monitor sales growth, and identify profit trends. It combines raw sales data with advanced Excel features like Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Slicers, and Conditional Formatting to transform static data into actionable insights.

Through this dashboard, users can:

✅ Evaluate total sales and profit over time.

✅ Monitor the number of orders and sales quantity across different years.

✅ Measure profit margins to assess overall business health.

✅ Analyze category-wise sales & profit (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).

✅ Compare the percentage sales share of each category.

✅ Track regional and state-wise performance with a geographic map.

✅ Drill down into top subcategories (like Phones, Chairs, Storage, Tables, Binders).

✅ Apply dynamic filters (Year, Segment, Region) for customized insights.

By using this dashboard, businesses can quickly answer critical questions such as:

📌 Which product categories are driving profit, and which are dragging it down?

📌 Which regions contribute the most to sales?

📌 What are the top subcategories that need more marketing investment?

📌 How has sales performance evolved year-over-year?

The ultimate goal of this project is to make data analysis easy and interactive in Excel—without requiring advanced BI tools like Power BI or Tableau—while still providing a professional-grade business intelligence experience.
